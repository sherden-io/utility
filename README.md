# utility
An Utility library with common useful classes and extensions.

You want to add pod 'iOSUtility', '~> 0.1' similar to the following to your Podfile:

```ruby
target 'MyApp' do
  pod 'iOSUtility', '~> 0.1'
end
```

Then run a ```pod install``` inside your terminal, or from CocoaPods.app.

Alternatively to give it a test run, run the command:

```pod try iOSUtility```
